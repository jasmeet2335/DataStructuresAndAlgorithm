     /*
      * Adjancency List - List of Lists 
        This is a list of all the vertices and then the elements in the list (verices) have a further list of all the nodes they are connected to. 
        ArrayList <ArrayList>
        Array <ArrayList>
        hashmap <int, lists>

        Edge contains source, distance and weight.

        Edge list- This contains list of all the edges.
        These are useful when we are required to perform sorting edges. Example- MST- Minimum Spanning Tree

        Implicit Graphs- This is useful in situations in which we are given a 2D matrix 
        We can visualize the given matrix in the form of a graph to say finding a shortest path from a point in matrix to the corner of the matrix.
