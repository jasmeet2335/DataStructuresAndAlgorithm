     * Binary Search Tree are similar to Binary trees where each parent can have 
     * only two nodes at max.
     * Binary Search tree take less time to seach in the tree 
     * than the BInary Trees. Where Binary tree take around O(n)
     * Binary Trees take just o(H). 
     * where n will be the nodes of the tree and H will be height if the tree
     * 
     * Additional properties that BST have
     * left Subtree Nodes < Root
     * Right Subtree Nodes > Root
     * left and right subtree are also BST with no duplicates.
     *  
     * Preorder- root > left > right
     * Inorder-  left > root > right
     * Postorder- left > right > root
     * Level Order 
     * 
     * Inorder Traveral of BST gives a sort sequence.
     * The general idea of BST helps us with the search algothrims as
     * the whole tree is sort and if we were required to search any value we can do this as
     * If the key > data then go right
     * else if key < data then go left. 
     * 
     * As have have said that the time complexity of BST is O(H)
     * which in worst case senario can be equal to o(n) [In the case of a skewed Tree]
     * In the best case senarion it is log n << n.
     * 
     * Stratergy: MOst problems will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing into 
     * subproblems and making recursive calls on subtrees.
